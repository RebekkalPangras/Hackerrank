Input Format

The first line contains the respective space-separated numerator and denominator for the probability of a defect, and the second line contains the inspection we want the probability of the first defect being discovered by:

1 3
5
If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

Solution:

n,d = map(int,input().split())
p = n/d
n_trial = int(input())
result = 0
for i in range(1,n_trial+1):
    result += (1-p)**(i-1)* p 
print("%.3f" %result)
