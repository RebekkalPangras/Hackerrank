Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

Task
Given two -element data sets,  and , calculate the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the size of data sets  and .
The second line contains  space-separated real numbers (scaled to at most one decimal place), defining data set .
The third line contains  space-separated real numbers (scaled to at most one decimal place), defining data set .

Constraints

, where  is the  value of data set .
, where  is the  value of data set .
Data set  contains unique values.
Data set  contains unique values.
Output Format

Print the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient, rounded to a scale of  decimal places.

Sample Input

10
10 9.8 8 7.8 7.7 7 6 5 4 2 
200 44 32 24 22 17 15 12 8 4
Sample Output

0.612

Solution:

n = int(input())
x = list(map(float,input().split()))
y = list(map(float,input().split()))
mean_x = 0
mean_y = 0
std_x = 0
std_y = 0
for i in range(n):
    mean_x += x[i]
    mean_y += y[i]
mean_x = mean_x/n
mean_y = mean_y/n
variance_x = 0
variance_y = 0
for i in range(n):
    variance_x += (x[i] - mean_x)**2
    variance_y += (y[i] - mean_y)**2
std_x = (variance_x/(n))**0.5
std_y = (variance_y/(n))**0.5

sum_value =  0

for i in range(n):
    sum_value += (x[i]-mean_x)*(y[i]-mean_y)

correlation = sum_value / (n*std_x*std_y)
print("%.3f"%correlation)
