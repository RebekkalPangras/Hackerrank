Objective
In the previous challenge, we calculated a mean. In this challenge, we practice calculating a weighted mean. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Given an array, , of  integers and an array, , representing the respective weights of 's elements, calculate and print the weighted mean of 's elements. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of  decimal place (i.e.,  format).

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of elements in arrays  and .
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array .
The third line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective elements of array .

Constraints

, where  is the  element of array .
, where  is the  element of array .
Output Format

Print the weighted mean on a new line. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of  decimal place (i.e.,  format).

Sample Input

5
10 40 30 50 20
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

32.0
Explanation

We use the following formula to calculate the weighted mean:

And then print our result to a scale of  decimal place () on a new line.

Solution:

n = int(input())
values = list(map(int,input().split()))
weights = list(map(int,input().split()))

weighted_mean = 0
weights_sum = 0

for i in range(n):
    weighted_mean += values[i]*weights[i]
    weights_sum += weights[i]

result = weighted_mean/weights_sum
print("%.1f"%result)
