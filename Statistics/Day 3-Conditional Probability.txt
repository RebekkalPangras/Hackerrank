Task
Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

Solution :

There are four possibilities for gender in a family of two kids. GG,GB,BG,BB. GG does not include in our case since one among the kid is surely a boy. So,now there are three possibilities, among which BB is what we need to find the probability for.

So, P(BB) = 1/3
