Task
A manufacturer of metal pistons finds that, on average,12%  of the pistons they manufacture are rejected because they are incorrectly sized. What is the probability that a batch of  10 pistons will contain:

No more than 2 rejects?
At least 2 rejects?
Input Format

A single line containing the following values (denoting the respective percentage of defective pistons and the size of the current batch of pistons):

12 10
If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

Output Format

Print the answer to each question on its own line:

The first line should contain the probability that a batch of  pistons will contain no more than  rejects.
The second line should contain the probability that a batch of  pistons will contain at least  rejects.
Round both of your answers to a scale of  decimal places (i.e.,  format).

Solution:

from math import *
s,n = map(float,input().split())
p = s/100

def not_more_than_2(n,p):
    result = 0
    for x in range(0,3):
        result += (factorial(n)/(factorial(x)*factorial(n-x))) * (p**x) * ((1-p)**(n-x))
    return result

result_1 = not_more_than_2(n,p)

def atleast_2(n,p):
    result = 0
    for x in range(0,2):
        result += (factorial(n)/(factorial(x)*factorial(n-x))) * (p**x) * ((1-p)**(n-x))
    return (1-result)

result_2 = atleast_2(n,p)

print("%.3f" % result_1)
print("%.3f" % result_2)
