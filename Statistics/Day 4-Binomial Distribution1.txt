Task
The ratio of boys to girls for babies born in Russia is 1.09:1 . If there is  child born per birth, what proportion of Russian families with exactly 6 children will have at least 3  boys?

Write a program to compute the answer using the above parameters. Then print your result, rounded to a scale of  decimal places (i.e.,1.234  format).

Input Format

A single line containing the following values:

1.09 1
If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

Output Format

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale 3 of  decimal places (i.e.,  format).

Solution:

from math import *
s,f = map(float,input().split())
p = s/(s+f)
result = 0
n = 6
for x in range(3,7):
    result += (factorial(n)/(factorial(x)*factorial(n-x))) * (p**x) * ((1-p)**(n-x))
print("%.3f"%result)
