Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event. We recommend you review today's Probability Tutorial before attempting this challenge.


Task
There are  urns labeled x ,y , and z .


Urn x  contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the  urns. What is the probability that, of the  balls drawn,  are red and  is black?

Ans :

Urn X has a 4/7 probability of giving a red ball
Urn Y has a 5/9 probability of giving a red ball
Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a red ball

Urn X has a 3/7 probability of giving a black ball
Urn Y has a 4/9 probability of giving a black ball
Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a black ball

P(2 red, 1 black)
= P(Red Red Black) + P(Red Black Red) + P(Black Red Red)
= (4/7)(5/9)(1/2) + (4/7)(4/9)(1/2) + (3/7)(5/9)(1/2)
= 20/126 + 16/126 + 15/126
= 51/126
= 17/42
