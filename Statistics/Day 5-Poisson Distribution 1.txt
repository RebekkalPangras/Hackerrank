Input Format

The first line contains 's mean. The second line contains the value we want the probability for:

2.5
5
If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

Solution:

import math
mean = float(input())
k = float(input())
print(((mean**k)*(math.exp(-mean)))/math.factorial(k))
